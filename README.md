An 2D game engine created out of DirectX & C++.

Recent demo is released.

Demo 1 is a playable vertical shoot-em-up (Arrow Keys to control and Z to fire).

There are 2 types of enemy aircrafts:
* Blue: She will keep throwing single bullet to your location. Also she will glide towards your direction for once and shoot 2 rockets when she's just above you.
* Green: She will move quickly and use machine gun when she's just above you. After several moves she will charge and perform a kamikaze attack.
